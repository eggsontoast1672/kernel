# Kernel

This is my attempt at writing a kernel. I'm planning on doing embedded systems
to some degree during my carreer, so in some way, this is kind of practice for
the real world. In another way, a way that is much more meaningful to me, I've
always been interested in kernels and low-level programming, so in that sense,
this project is simply to satiate my desire to learn more about that aspect of
software development.

There isn't much code, but it's a start. Just some hand-written assembly that
prints some greetings to the screen and then hangs. Doing actually useful stuff
is something I'm still working on.
